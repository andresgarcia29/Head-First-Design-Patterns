# Design Principle

## The Strategy Pattern

- Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same.

- Program to an interface, not an implementation.

- Favor composition over inheritance.

## ObserverPattern

- Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.
